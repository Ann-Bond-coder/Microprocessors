# Atmega 128 microcontroller input/output ports

**Task 1:** Develop a program on Assembler that implements the calculation of a logic equation according 
to the option. Compile and debug and test the functionality of the program on AVR-Studio.  
Input port: C  
Output port: V  
Input bits are 7. /4, 1, 0  
The output bit is /2  
Operations - ++ *  

**Task 2:** Write a program in which two four-bit numbers A (bits PA0...PA3) and B (bits PB0...PB3) are entered, the result is output to port C and the following operation C=A<operation>B is performed:  
The port code is ACD  
Operation - logical operation "Exclusive OR"   
Tetrad code: 5
