# Study of AV microcontroller control transfer commands and methods of programming time delays

**Task 1:** Write a routine that rewrites a sequence of numbers from one register to another. If 6 bits of 
R12 = 0, then the entry is made as follows: R12->R22, R13->R23, R14->R24, otherwise R22->R12, R23->R13, R24->R14.
