# Development for the AVR Studio simulator software environment for developing programs for microcontrollers of the AVR family

**Task 1:** The program alternately, with a software-created delay, writes 1 to 7 and 6 bits of port D, which causes VD1, VD2 to turn 
on, respectively. In order to observe this sequence of switches visually, a delay is created in the program by a delay routine 
that uses the execution of nested loops.  

**Task 2:** Write a program that differs from the previous one in that the first diode lights up three times with a period of 3 seconds, 
then the second diode three times with a period of 5 seconds. The cycle should be repeated 50 times.
